    Creating an Exploration
  </h2>

  <p>
    After you've played an exploration, why not try your hand at making one? To
    do so, navigate to the gallery, and look for the "Create"
    button in the top navbar.
  </p>

  <p>
    This will take you to a new page, click on the setting icon on the top right 
    corner of the page, it takes you to a page where in you fill the basic settings 
    for your exploration.
  </p>

  <p>
    The page asks for a few things:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>A title.</strong> Pick a short, descriptive title that conveys
      the essence of your exploration.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>A goal.</strong> What is the exploration supposed to help the
      player learn?
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>A category.</strong> You can select one of the predefined
      categories, or define your own.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>A language.</strong> This is the language that your exploration
      is written in. (In the special case of explorations that teach languages,
      this should be the language that the exploration is written in, not the
      language that the exploration is trying to teach.)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Name of first Card.</strong> You might want to give your very first 
      card a name, this makes it possible by filling in the name here.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Tags.</strong> This helps your learner discover your exploration when
      searching. You might like to give those names that are closely related to 
      your exploration name or purpose.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Once you've done that, there are other options, those you shall use as you go
    on creating your exploration. Once you are through, scroll to the buttom of 
    the page and click the green "save draft" button in the tabs at the top right.
    Congratulations, you've created a new exploration!
